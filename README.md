# ProxyServer

This is my Assignment 1 for SOFE4790 Distributed Systems.
I have designed and implemented a HTTP Proxy using low-level sockets programming in Java

# Getting Started

To get this running, all you need is to clone this repo to your local and get the java program compiled using JDK components.

`Asmy$ javac MyProxy.java`

Next step would be to set up a web proxy with your browser on the port I have mentioned in this program.
`7890` is the port I have used in this program hence that will be the port you'll be setting your browser with.
You can start running this program and access the sites through the browser you've set up the proxy with.

`Asmy$ java MyProxy`
